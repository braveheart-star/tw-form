# Form Field Usage

Add two custom Tailwind configration
borderColor: ['focus-within'],

theme: {
  extend: {
    transformOrigin: {
      "0": "0%",
    },
    zIndex: {
      "-1": "-1",
    },
  },
},

See details in `webpack.config.js`

Add space as place holders for the field you want floating labels

For using only place holders you can use it directly just don't add label
